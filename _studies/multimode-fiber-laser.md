## Physical Perspective

From a physical standpoint, a multimode fiber laser should be viewed as a **driven–dissipative nonlinear system with many coupled degrees of freedom**.  
Each transverse mode carries its own dispersion, gain competition, and nonlinear phase evolution, while the gain medium enforces global constraints through saturation and energy redistribution.

Unlike conventional single-mode lasers, multimode operation does not merely introduce additional modes — it fundamentally changes the structure of the phase space.  
The observed laser states correspond to **attractors in a high-dimensional spatiotemporal dynamical system**, rather than isolated steady states.

A central hypothesis of this study is that many experimentally observed multimode laser regimes can be understood as **low-dimensional emergent dynamics** arising from strong mode coupling, rather than as independent modal oscillations.
